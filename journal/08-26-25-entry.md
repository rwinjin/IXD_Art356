Chapter 1

This chapter was a bit of a refresher for me as I read this book already for another UX class, although its been about a year so I have forgotten a lot of the book. Something I can relate to deeply in the book is how bad design can turn something easy and straighfoward into a frustration experience. The quote, "If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform gracefully and smoothly would neither surprise nor bother me. But I shouldn't have trouble with doors and switches, water faucets and stoves." (p2), is something I relate to. I have a few light switches in my house that don't line up to the light that I think it would. Because the light takes a second to fully be bright, I would have to wait a second to see if I hit the right switch or not. Another thing I can relate to in this chapter is the quote, "Mapping problems are abundant, one of the fundamental causes of difficulties." (p23) Mapping problems always makes things more frustrating then they have to be, especially in video games. For example, most games use WASD for movement, and if it's a first person shooter, left click to shoot and r to reload. When a game doesn't follow these controls, it makes getting used to the game hard as these controls have been pretty universal for most games.
